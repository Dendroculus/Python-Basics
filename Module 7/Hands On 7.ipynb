    "\n",
    "Welcome to Module 7! No program is perfect; errors happen. A robust application anticipates and handles errors gracefully instead of crashing. This module covers Python's exception handling system and the standard `logging` library, which allows you to record events and diagnose problems effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our goals are to understand:**\n",
    "- **Exceptions vs. Syntax Errors**: The two main types of errors.\n",
    "- **Handling Exceptions**: Using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.\n",
    "- **Raising Exceptions**: How and when to trigger errors intentionally with `raise`.\n",
    "- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating your own error types for specific application logic.\n",
    "- **Logging Basics**: Why `logging` is superior to `print()` for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "- **Logging Levels**: How to categorize messages by severity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`)."

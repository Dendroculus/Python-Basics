    "\n",
    "Welcome to our final core module. Before we begin, I want to express my gratitude for your dedication throughout this course. If any of the concepts in Modules 1 through 7 felt challenging or unclear, please know that this is a natural part of the learning process. Programming is a skill built layer by layer, and each new topic reinforces the last. My hope is that this final module on Object-Oriented Programming will tie many of those concepts together, providing a powerful new way to structure your code.\n",

    "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (attributes) and code to manipulate that data (methods). It's the foundation of most modern, large-scale software.\n",

    "- **Classes and Objects**: The fundamental building blocks of OOP.\n",
    "- **Attributes and Methods**: Defining the data and behavior of objects.\n",
    "- **The `self` Keyword**: How an object refers to itself.\n",
    "- **Properties**: A Pythonic way to control attribute access.\n",
    "- **Dataclasses**: A modern shortcut for creating data-centric classes."

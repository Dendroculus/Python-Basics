    "- **`pathlib`**: The modern, object-oriented way to work with filesystem paths.\n",
    "- **The `with` statement**: The standard for safely opening and closing files.\n",
    "- **Reading & Writing Plain Text**: The fundamentals of file I/O.\n",
    "- **CSV Files**: How to read and write Comma-Separated Values data.\n",
    "- **JSON Files**: How to work with JavaScript Object Notation for data interchange.\n",
